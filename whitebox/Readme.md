# Whitebox Tools

Running whitebox tools in the virtual machine is a little tricky due to library conflicts in the DSGs virtual machine.

The script here will set up an environment, build the tools and the a python environment so you can use them.

As we need to install a few packages this will require you to use your password on your virtual machines.

## Installation

Once you have cloned the repo, open up the terminal app and navigate to this folder.

First run

```
bash whiteboxInstallerUbuntu18.sh
```


This will take a few minutes to run and will ask you for your password. When it is done, you can start whitebox tools.

## Running Whitebox tools

Once you have installed the app you can start the tools but openning up your terminal app again, navigating to this folder and typing:

```
bash runWhiteBox.sh
```
