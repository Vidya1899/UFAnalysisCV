Leveraging LiDAR and Street View Data for Road Feature Detection with Ordnance Survey Northern Ireland
-------------------------------

### Description
 
The National Mapping Agency of Northern Irelandâ€™s (OSNI) mission is to provide high quality geospatial data.  Historically this has been 2D mapping, but modern survey techniques and increasing user requirements have shifted focus toward 3D data.  Since 2019, OSNI has operated a vehicle mounted Mobile Mapping System (Leica Pegasus) across Northern Ireland capturing 3D point cloud data and spherical street view imagery.
This project seeks to explore the potential of this highly detailed LiDAR and Imagery data via machine learning and other data science methods, with a focus on developing pipelines to classify and identify urban features like drainage. We also welcome participants who are up for exploring various ways to process, study and visualise LiDAR and Imagery data of this detail.
 
Useful skills:
Computer Vision (CNN), Geospatial Visualisation, LiDAR Data Processing, Machine-Learning
